Self-hosting Jojoblacklist Popup
You can run Jojoblacklist Popup locally without having to install it from the Chrome Store. Here's how:

Download the latest Buildv1.0.0.zip from the releases page
Load the extension by pasting chrome://extensions/ in the address bar, and enabling developer mode.
Drag the folder that contains the code (make sure it's a folder and not a ZIP file, so unzip first), or click on the "Load unpacked" button and locate the folder.
That's it, you should now be able to use Jojoblacklist Popup locally.
